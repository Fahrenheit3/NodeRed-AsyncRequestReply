# NodeRed-AsyncRequestReply
One of my Node-Red subflows for Google Summer of Code. (Asynchronous Request-Reply pattern implemented...)

DESCRIPTION:
  This subflow is used to send requests to certain URLs. There are two request types which are used in this flow. The POST and the GET requests. The responses come in msg.payload as a JSON string which then turned into an object.
